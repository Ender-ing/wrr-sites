# web-page.click

Users can host websites as subdomains of the default domain, *web-page.click*.

## Adding custom domains

To enable users to a custom domain for use with their website, they must point the nameservers of thier domain to the following nameservers:

```txt
ns1.sites.ender.ing
ns2.sites.ender.ing
```

Or they could use CNAME records to do so.

## Hosting plans

New users are automatically assigned to the *Newcomer Plan*, which limits their access to server resources as follows:

```txt
Traffic: 50 GB per month
Storage: 1 GB
Domains: 1
MySQL DBs: 5
```

Only secure Ender accounts are allowed to be upgraded to the *Trusted Plan*, after they have in active use for at least one week!

```txt
Traffic: ~8796 PB per month (basically unlimited)
Storage: ~8796 PB (basically unlimited)
Domains: 100
MySQL DBs: 100
```

> Note: (PB = 1000 TB = 1000000 GB)
